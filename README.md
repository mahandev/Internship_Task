# Internship_Task

The project consists of 2 major events.

1) Adding the CSV contents to the SQLite Database
2) Projecting the information from SQLite Database to the Website

The / directory leads the user to the website where they can search for any dish and it will be displayed in the order of the highest rating(The app's preference)

The /data directory adds the CSV data to the SQLite database.(NO NEED TO RUN!!!)

All parts of important code are commented with my thoughts behind the program.
